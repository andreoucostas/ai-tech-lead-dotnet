description: One-time bootstrap — analyse this .NET codebase and populate CLAUDE.md, TECH_DEBT.md, AGENTS.md, and copilot-instructions.md.
---

Read `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md` in this repository, then execute the bootstrap workflow defined there.

`.claude/commands/bootstrap.md` is the single source of truth. Follow it exactly: pre-flight checks → eight analysis passes (A1–A8) → synthesis into priority tiers → clarify gate → generate artifacts (`CLAUDE.md`, `TECH_DEBT.md`, `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md` drafts, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) → final report with diff summary.

Run the full pipeline. The only pauses are the ones the workflow defines (Phase 2b clarifying questions, Phase 3d-bis hazard confirmation) — do not add others. Remind the user at the end to verify the generated `CLAUDE.md > Conventions` section — it drives everything else.

# ai-tech-lead-dotnet — Changelog

> Framework-level changes for the .NET template. Per-stack Angular changes live in [`ai-tech-lead-angular/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/andreoucostas/ai-tech-lead-angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
> Architecture decisions (cross-stack) live in `project_framework_architecture.md`.

## 0.23.1 — 2026-06-29 (hook test harness: automated, twin-parity-checked tests for the framework's own hooks)

> The framework's own hooks and scripts had **zero automated tests** — only manual recipes — and that gap had already shipped a real defect: in 0.23.0 the bash `guard.sh` was found missing the test-defeat blocks its `guard.ps1` twin enforced (a silent twin-drift the manual process didn't catch). This release adds a **dependency-free PowerShell test harness** (no Pester, so it runs air-gapped and under Windows PowerShell 5.1) that pipes JSON events to each hook and asserts exit code + per-surface output (Claude `exit 2`+stderr vs Copilot `permissionDecision` JSON), plus **behavioural twin-parity** tests that run the `.ps1` and `.sh` on the same input and assert the same decision — the check that would have caught the `guard.sh` regression. Authored in lockstep with the Angular twin.

### Added
- **`tests/hooks/` hook test harness** — `_HookHarness.ps1` (dependency-free runner: pipes an event to a hook, captures exit/stdout/stderr, normalises to a BLOCK/DENY/ALLOW decision; drives `.sh` twins via Git's `bin\bash.exe` for full-PATH fidelity; falls back to `powershell.exe` when `pwsh` is absent; `.sh` tests self-skip when no bash is present), `Guard.Tests.ps1` (surface matrix over every block pattern + clean inputs, incl. the RxJS `skip()` and `*Tests*`-file false-positive allowances), `TwinParity.Tests.ps1` (deep `guard` `.ps1`↔`.sh` decision parity on both surfaces + empty/malformed-stdin robustness parity for every twin pair), a shared fixture library (`fixtures/guard-cases.ps1`), and `Invoke-HookTests.ps1` (suite runner; exit code = failing-test count).

### CI
- Run as a **dedicated step**: `pwsh -NoProfile -File tests/hooks/Invoke-HookTests.ps1` (fail the build on non-zero exit). Intentionally **not** wired into `docs-sync-check` (which early-exits on `.template-repo` and is a framework-state guardrail, not a test runner).

## 0.23.0 — 2026-06-25 (workflow disciplines made reachable on Copilot; deterministic write-floor extended to VS Code; false enforcement claims removed)

> The framework's value is gated behind workflow commands the target developers won't type, and on the primary surface (GitHub Copilot in VS Code against a local Bitbucket Data Center) the picture was worse than assumed: routing/plan-gate/security context **cannot** be injected there (Copilot discards `sessionStart`/`userPromptSubmitted` stdout; VS Code agent-hooks are Preview-only), and the one Copilot write-block we shipped used a JSON shape (`{decision,reason}`) that **no longer matches the current Copilot spec** — i.e. the v0.22.0 Copilot guard had silently become a no-op. This release (a) inlines every workflow's non-negotiables into the always-on `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` §1 so classification leads to discipline on Copilot without a slash command, (b) fixes the guard deny shape and extends the deterministic write-floor to VS Code agent mode, and (c) stops the framework claiming enforcement on surfaces where it doesn't fire. Authored in lockstep with the Angular twin. Researched against the Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and VS Code agent-hooks references (June 2026).

> **Migration note:** *when* discipline fires has changed. The `route-prompt` per-prompt rails now point at `CLAUDE.md §1` as the canonical source (they remain a just-in-time salience copy, not an independent fork), and a question-shaped prompt with no imperative verb is now treated as answer-only (no workflow ceremony). If you relied on the old keyword-listed session-start primer "routing on Copilot," note that it never did — see `docs/enforcement-surfaces.md`.

### Fixed
- **`guard.ps1`/`.sh` Copilot deny shape was a no-op.** It emitted `{"decision":"deny","reason":…}`; current Copilot honours `{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":…}`. Now emits a **superset** (top-level *and* `hookSpecificOutput`-nested `permissionDecision`) so a single output blocks on **both Copilot CLI and VS Code agent mode**. The Claude Code `exit 2` path is unchanged.
- **The guard no-opped on VS Code entirely** — its tool-name switch only matched Claude/CLI names, never VS Code's camelCase tools. It now gates on *"the payload carries a file path + content"* (surface-agnostic), so secret-writes and test-defeats are blocked under VS Code agent mode too (when Preview agent-hooks are enabled).

### Added
- **`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` §1 now carries each workflow's non-negotiables inline** (fix → root-cause-then-regression-test-first; refactor → green-before-touch + net LOC delta; test → red-before-green, no over-mocking; etc.). Previously these lived only in `commands/*.md`, which Copilot never auto-loads — so a Copilot dev who never typed `/fix` got "follow the fix workflow" with no reachable definition. §1 is now the **canonical routing definition** and the load-bearing surface on Copilot.
- **`docs/enforcement-surfaces.md`** — the honest guaranteed-vs-instructed matrix per surface (Claude Code / Copilot CLI / Copilot VS Code). Linked from §1 and `hooks.json`.
- **Answer-only carve-out** in `route-prompt` + §1: a question-shaped prompt with no imperative verb is answered directly, no plan-gate ceremony (reduces false-positive routing without advertising an override keyword).

### Changed
- **`route-prompt.ps1`/`.sh` intro now names `CLAUDE.md §1` as the canonical source** the rails mirror (the rails stay for just-in-time salience on Claude; they are bound to §1, not deleted).
- **`session-start.ps1`/`.sh` no longer re-lists a routing keyword vocabulary** and no longer claims to route on Copilot (Copilot discards its stdout); it now points at §1. Comment in `.github/hooks/hooks.json` corrected accordingly.
- **`generate-copilot.md`** now mandates the §1 block be copied **verbatim** into `AGENTS.md` (carved out of the "may be condensed to one line per step" license) — otherwise regeneration would erase the inline non-negotiables from the one surface that needs them.
- **`/docs-sync`** gained two binding checks: AGENTS.md §1 must match `CLAUDE.md` §1 verbatim, and the `route-prompt` rails must stay substance-consistent with §1.

### Verification
- `guard.*` re-verified on all three surfaces: Claude `Edit` + AWS key → `exit 2` + stderr; Copilot CLI `edit` + key → `permissionDecision` JSON (exit 0); VS Code `create`/`str_replace` + key **or** `Assert.True(true)` → superset `permissionDecision` JSON (exit 0, the newly-covered surface); clean content → exit 0. `guard.*` byte-identical across both repos; UTF-8 BOM preserved.
- All four edited hooks (`route-prompt`, `session-start`) parse clean under Windows PowerShell 5.1 + pwsh 7 and `bash -n`; answer-only suppression confirmed (a pure "why does this throw?" emits no rails; "fix the login crash" routes).
- **Task 0 (VS Code Preview-hook spike) was run and confirmed agent-hooks DO fire in VS Code agent mode.** The captured payload uses the Anthropic text-editor tool schema — `create` (`toolArgs.path` + `toolArgs.file_text`), `str_replace`/`insert` (`new_str`) — field names the guard's extractor did **not** previously read, so VS Code writes would have slipped the floor. Added `file_text` / `new_str` / `path` to the field extraction (both `guard.ps1` and `guard.sh`, jq + python paths); re-verified the guard blocks a `create`+secret and `str_replace`+private-key under the real VS Code shape. **Verified end-to-end:** a `create` of a deny-listed path in VS Code agent mode was blocked at runtime with the hook's reason surfaced to the model — the superset `permissionDecision` deny is honored. (Enablement remains org-gated: where Preview agent-hooks are disabled, VS Code degrades to instruction-only, as documented.)
- **`guard.sh` brought to parity with `guard.ps1`:** the bash path was missing the v0.22.0 test-defeat blocks (a lockstep miss). It now also blocks `[Fact/Theory(Skip=…)]`, `Assert.True(true)`/`Assert.False(false)`, `fit`/`fdescribe`/`.only`, `xit`/`xdescribe`/`.skip`, and `expect(true).toBe(true)` — verified firing on Claude (exit 2) and Copilot (`permissionDecision` JSON), and verified to still ALLOW the RxJS `skip()` operator and clean files.

## 0.22.0 — 2026-06-25 (test integrity: defend against the test pathologies AI assistants are most prone to)

> The framework had a strong testing *philosophy* (behaviour-first, lean, characterization-before-refactor) but three structural gaps: no guidance on test *shape* (only test types); no defence against the failure mode its own users are most exposed to — AI assistants routinely emit over-mocked, tautological tests that pass even when the code is broken (2026 empirical studies across Claude/Copilot/Cursor; majority-incorrect LLM oracles); and an enforcement asymmetry where architecture had a deterministic CI gate but testing had only soft review. This release closes the doctrine + cheap-enforcement gaps. Coverage-as-diagnostic and CI-enforced diff-scoped mutation testing are scoped for 0.23.0. Authored in lockstep with the Angular twin.

### Added
- **`test-critic` review agent** (`.claude/agents/test-critic.md` + `.github/agents/test-critic.agent.md`), spawned by `/review` alongside the existing four auditors. Its single question per test: *would this fail if the code under test broke?* Flags oracle-invalid (would-not-fail) tests, over-mocking, weak assertions, missing error/edge paths, implementation-coupling, nondeterminism, and financial-domain gaps — a separate context from the code author, per the "the agent doing the work isn't the one grading it" principle. `/review`'s output block is renamed **Test Quality & Coverage** with a would-fail-if-broken verdict.
- **Test-integrity rules** (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` > Leanness > Test leanness #14–#16): no over-mocking (mock only true external boundaries; prefer fakes/in-memory for owned code), no tautological assertions, assert behaviour not implementation — each with its plain-language *why*.
- **Verification Rule #9 — red before green**: a new behavioral test must be *seen to fail* against broken/pre-fix code before it is trusted; generalised from the bug-fix-only habit already in `fix.md`. The cheapest defence against vacuous tests.
- **Test shape + determinism defaults** (`docs/defaults.md`): an architecture-conditioned shape heuristic (push each test to the lowest level that runs real behaviour; unit-dense domain logic, integration for cross-cutting paths via `WebApplicationFactory`, sparse full-stack; honeycomb/risk-based for boundary-heavy services; the inverted / ice-cream-cone anti-shape) plus a determinism/hermeticity stanza. Bootstrap-overridable.

### Changed
- **`guard.ps1` PreToolUse hook now hard-blocks test-defeats** (deterministic floor; both surfaces/shells preserved — exit 2 + stderr for Claude, JSON deny for Copilot, `-ceq`, UTF-8 BOM): `[Fact/Theory(Skip=…)]` and `Assert.True(true)`/`Assert.False(false)` in `*.cs`; `fit`/`fdescribe`/`.only`/`xit`/`xdescribe`/`.skip` and `expect(true).toBe(true)` in `*.spec.ts`. Enforces the previously-unenforced "no focused/skipped tests" convention.
- **`add-tests` skill and `/test`** gained the over-mocking/real-oracle guidance and the red-before-green check; `/test` now points at the Test shape heuristic and states the TDD position (no test-first mandate for features; red-first for fixes and regressions).
- **`/feature` final subtask** reworded from "integration test" to integration / end-to-end verification exercising the real pipeline as a caller would (Anthropic field finding: agents pass unit/integration but miss end-to-end) — parity with the Angular workflow.
- **§5 Verification & confidence line** now requires showing the evidence — the command run and its observed pass/fail counts — not the bare claim "tests pass."
- **`metrics.ps1`** discloses two new anti-pattern counts (`tests_skipped`, `tautological_assert`) for `/impact` — disclosure, not a gate. A `test-integrity-real-oracle` probe was added to `tests/impact/tasks.json` so the change is measurable through the framework's own A/B harness.

### Verification
- `guard.ps1` re-verified under Windows PowerShell 5.1 and pwsh 7: blocks `[Fact(Skip=…)]`, `Assert.True(true)`, `fit(`, `it.only`, `expect(true).toBe(true)` (exit 2); passes clean tests and the RxJS `skip()` operator (exit 0); existing `#pragma` / `@ts-ignore` blocks unaffected; UTF-8 BOM preserved.
- `guard.ps1` and `metrics.ps1` parse cleanly (0 errors); `metrics.ps1` runs and emits the new keys; `tests/impact/tasks.json` is valid JSON with the new probe.
- `.github/skills` re-synced and byte-identical to `.claude/skills`; `test-critic` mirrored to `.github/agents`; `AGENTS.md` updated with Rule #9 and Test leanness #14–#16; both repos stamped `0.22.0`; `docs-sync-check` clean. The impact A/B run itself (`impact-run.ps1`, needs Copilot CLI + two git refs) was not executed this session.

## 0.21.0 — 2026-06-12 (hook feedback actually reaches the model; PowerShell 5.1 hooks un-broken)

> Field finding (consumer report): "hooks always exit with 0 — build failures silently get ignored." Confirmed, and the audit found three distinct silent-failure mechanisms, all in the feedback path between a hook and the model. The hooks *ran* fine; their output went nowhere. Verified against the Claude Code hooks reference (exit-code/stdout semantics per event) and the GitHub Copilot hooks reference (stdout parsed as JSON only).

### Fixed
- **`post-write` build failures never reached the model** (`post-write.sh` + `.ps1`). Claude Code feeds PostToolUse output to the model only via **exit 2 + stderr** — plain exit-0 stdout goes to the debug log; Copilot consumes postToolUse stdout only as **JSON** (`{"additionalContext": …}`). The hook printed plain text and exited 0: invisible on both surfaces, so the agent kept working on top of a broken build. Now: Claude surface → failure tail on stderr + exit 2; Copilot surface (`edit`/`create` tool names) → `additionalContext` JSON on stdout. The throttle stamp is also cleared on failure so the next write rebuilds instead of skipping the known-broken build for the rest of the 60 s window (previously the failure wouldn't even resurface). `post-write.sh` additionally gained a `tool_name` initialisation — under `set -u` the new surface branch would otherwise abort on the python3 fallback path.
- **`boy-scout-check` Stop-hook findings were equally invisible** (`boy-scout-check.sh` + `.ps1`). Findings addressed to the agent ("address them … before considering the work complete") were emitted as plain exit-0 stdout, which Stop hooks send to the debug log only. Now emitted as `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "Stop", "additionalContext": …}}` — the model sees the findings, and the hook stays *soft* (no forced continuation). Switch to `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` for strict enforcement, as before.
- **`guard.ps1` failed open for Claude's `Edit` tool.** PowerShell `-eq` is case-insensitive, so `'Edit' -eq 'edit'` routed Claude's Edit through the **Copilot** branch: a JSON deny on stdout with exit 0, which Claude Code does not honour as a block — the write went through. Now `-ceq` (the bash twin was never affected; `case` patterns are case-sensitive). The same comparison in the new `post-write` surface branch uses `-ceq` from the start. `Write` was unaffected, which is why the guard appeared to work.
- **No `.ps1` in the repo parsed under Windows PowerShell 5.1** where it contained non-ASCII. All `.ps1` files were BOM-less UTF-8; 5.1 reads those as ANSI, so the em-dashes inside `guard.ps1`'s string literals mangled into multi-byte garbage and produced a **hard parse error** — on `settings.windows.json` installs (the no-pwsh fallback) the guard never blocked anything, exiting 1 (which PreToolUse treats as non-blocking). UTF-8 BOM added to **every** `.ps1` in the repo (hooks + scripts); required by 5.1, harmless under pwsh 7.

### Verification
- All four post-write paths exercised with a stubbed failing/passing toolchain under pwsh 7, Windows PowerShell 5.1, and bash: Claude failure → exit 2 + stderr; Copilot failure → `additionalContext` JSON + exit 0; success → silent exit 0, stamp kept. Guard re-verified blocking on both surfaces and both shells; boy-scout JSON verified well-formed from both shells; all 23 `.ps1` files across both template repos re-parse cleanly.

## 0.20.0 — 2026-06-11 (mode-aware installer; adoption-pending becomes durable, machine-checked state)

> Field finding: an agent (Opus 4.8) given this repo and asked to "implement the framework" ran the install script and stopped — `/adopt` never happened. Root causes: `/adopt` is deliberately not model-invocable and didn't exist in the installing session anyway; every pointer to it was ephemeral stdout or README prose addressed to a human; and the only durable post-install state (`BOOTSTRAP_PENDING`) steered the *wrong* way (`/bootstrap`). Worse, on brownfield targets the installer overwrote the very artifacts `/adopt` exists to merge (the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TECH_DEBT.md`, …). This release makes the installer mode-aware and turns "adoption pending" into durable state that the SessionStart hook, CI, and `/bootstrap` all enforce — with an explicit handoff contract for installing agents.

### Added
- **Installer mode detection** (`scripts/install.ps1`/`.sh`): **greenfield** / **brownfield** / **update**, decided from an `/adopt`-Phase-1-style artifact scan and the presence of `.claude/framework-version.json`. The mode is printed and drives the next-steps output.
- **Brownfield: originals preserved + durable marker.** Files the copy would clobber (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TECH_DEBT.md`, `SECURITY_FINDINGS.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) are moved to `docs/pre-adoption/` *before* the copy, and `.claude/adoption-pending.json` records the detected artifacts and the archive mapping.
- **SessionStart adoption warning** (`session-start.ps1`/`.sh`): while the marker exists, every new session opens with 🔴 ADOPTION PENDING — next step is `/adopt`, **not** `/bootstrap`; the model cannot invoke it, so agents must stop and hand off to the developer. Takes precedence over the `BOOTSTRAP_PENDING` warning, which previously pointed brownfield repos at the wrong command.
- **CI guardrail**: `docs-sync-check.ps1`/`.sh` gained check 0 — fail while `.claude/adoption-pending.json` exists.
- **`/bootstrap` pre-flight guard** (check 0, `bootstrap.md`): aborts and redirects to `/adopt` when the marker exists, or when live AI artifacts (`.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `GEMINI.md`, …) exist without `docs/pre-adoption/`. `/adopt`'s own Phase-7 bootstrap run is unaffected — its Phase 3 clears both conditions first.
- **Agent handoff contract** (installer output + README §1): an installing agent's task ends with copy + commit + telling the developer verbatim to start a Claude Code session in the target repo and type `/adopt` (or `/bootstrap`); it must not attempt the command or replicate it by hand. The installer's brownfield output now addresses the agent case explicitly ("IF YOU ARE AN AI AGENT running this installer: …").

### Changed
- **`/adopt` consumes the marker** (`adopt.md`): Phase 0 reads `.claude/adoption-pending.json` as a discovery seed; Phase 1 treats installer-archived originals as merge candidates at their original paths (the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` is now the template — the consumer's original lives in `docs/pre-adoption/`); Phase 3 deletes the marker; the definition of done includes its removal.
- **Update runs no longer clobber consumer content**: re-running the installer on a repo stamped with `.claude/framework-version.json` refreshes the framework machinery but restores the consumer-owned content files listed above (previously a re-run overwrote a populated `CLAUDE.md` with the template).
- **Installer no longer ships template-repo meta files**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` are excluded from the copy — previously they overwrote the consumer's own README/changelog/gitignore. This aligns the installer with the documented copy list in README Quick Start §1.

## 0.19.0 — 2026-06-10 (slash commands exposed to model-driven invocation)

> Previously none of the 14 `.claude/commands/*.md` files had frontmatter, so Claude Code's SlashCommand tool could not surface them to the model: in natural-language chat the model could never escalate from the condensed `route-prompt` rails to the full workflow — even when those rails explicitly told it to ("Run /security-review on the diff"). The architecture is hook-as-floor, command-as-ceiling; this release makes the ceiling model-reachable. The `route-prompt` hook keeps injecting the deterministic floor on every prompt; the model can now invoke the full command (e.g. `/review`'s four-auditor fan-out) when the condensed rails aren't enough.

### Added
- **`description:` frontmatter on all 14 command files**, written as routing guidance (when to invoke, what the command spawns and produces). This exposes the workflow commands — `/feature`, `/fix`, `/refactor`, `/test`, `/design`, `/debt`, `/review`, `/security-review`, `/generate-copilot`, `/docs-sync` — to model-driven invocation via the SlashCommand tool.
- **`argument-hint:` frontmatter** on the workflow commands that take `$ARGUMENTS`, for slash-menu autocomplete.

### Changed
- **Setup/maintenance commands opted out of model invocation**: `/bootstrap`, `/rebootstrap`, `/adopt`, and `/impact` carry `disable-model-invocation: true` — they reshape the framework configuration or run the A/B harness, and stay developer-initiated.

## 0.18.0 — 2026-06-10 (FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md fully auto-drafted by `/bootstrap`)

> Previously `/bootstrap` populated only two of FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md's seven sections (Detected Framework Packages, Known Hazard Areas); the five context sections (Production Architecture, Shared Libraries, Multi-Tenancy, Dashboard Integration, Cross-Service Communication) stayed as "_Not yet populated_" placeholders waiting on a maintainer — and in practice stayed empty (observed in real adoptions). They are now auto-drafted from single-repo evidence with explicit honesty about scope: the draft describes what *this repo's code shows*, opens with a comment handing the cross-repo half to a maintainer, and a section with no signals gets a verified negative ("no multi-tenancy signals found — checked X, Y, Z") instead of a placeholder.

### Added
- **`/bootstrap` Phase 3d-ter** (`bootstrap.md`). Drafts the five context sections from Read/Grep evidence: repo classification + consumes/exposes (Production Architecture); per-detected-package consumed-surface entries titled "Consumed API surface (observed in this repo)" — never "latest" (Shared Libraries); tenant signals such as `TenantId`, tenant claims, `HasQueryFilter` (Multi-Tenancy); health-check/registration wiring (Dashboard Integration); `AddHttpClient`/resilience/message-bus/correlation-ID wiring (Cross-Service Communication). Non-interactive — drafts land in the PR diff for content review, same path as mined skills. Never touches a section a maintainer has written (per-section `*_PENDING` markers gate it).
- **Per-section `*_PENDING` markers** in the FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md template, so drafting is gated per section and maintainer-written content deterministically survives re-runs.
- **Phase 4 report bullet**: one line per drafted section (what was found, or the verified negative) with the reminder that cross-repo facts still need a maintainer.

### Changed
- **FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md header**. Maintenance note reflects that every section is now bootstrap-drafted; versioning caveat distinguishes auto-drafted entries (consumed surface at the pinned version) from maintainer entries (may document latest).
- **`/docs-sync` Step 4** (`docs-sync.md`). Per-section drift now re-checks the four architecture/communication sections against the 3d-ter evidence lists and proposes updates in the report (still never rewrites in place).
- **`/adopt` Phase 7** (`adopt.md`). Explicitly drafts the still-unpopulated context sections; sections filled by merged content in Phase 4 are left untouched.

### Fixed
- **`bootstrap.prompt.md` wrapper had drifted**: claimed seven analysis passes (now eight, A8 added in 0.16.0) and "do not ask for confirmation between phases" (contradicting the 0.17.0 interactive gates). Now defers to the workflow's own pauses.
- **CLAUDE.md template version stamp** had drifted from `.claude/framework-version.json` (0.13.2 vs 0.17.0); both now read 0.18.0.

## 0.17.0 — 2026-06-10 (interactive gates in `/bootstrap` and `/adopt`)

> `/bootstrap` now pauses at two points for developer input rather than running end-to-end and deferring all review to a PR. Phase 2b collects ≤5 targeted questions (convention contradictions, pattern intent, financial domain scope) in a single message before generating any artifact — the developer's answers are baked in, not deferred. Phase 3d-bis asks each candidate hazard as a plain engineering question before writing it to FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md; answers map to `[VERIFIED]`, `[REVIEWED: not a hazard — <date>]`, or `[UNVERIFIED]` — no row is dropped (audit trail preserved). `/adopt` Phase 4a reframes contradiction-resolution from an AI-artifact-merge question into a plain engineering choice with a safe default and an "accept all defaults" escape.

### Changed
- **`/bootstrap` Phase 2b** (`bootstrap.md`). New clarify-before-writing gate: ≤5 questions in one message, covering convention contradictions, pattern intent, and financial domain scope (.NET only). Skip signal ("proceed", "accept defaults") continues without markers; `<!-- INFERRED -->` reserved for genuine code ambiguity only.
- **`/bootstrap` Phase 3d-bis** (`bootstrap.md`). Rewrites the hazard-confirmation step: each candidate hazard is asked in-session before being written, not after. Answered rows get `[VERIFIED]` or `[REVIEWED: not a hazard — <date>]`; unanswered rows remain `[UNVERIFIED]`. All rows are written (none dropped).
- **`/bootstrap` Phase 4 reminder** (`bootstrap.md`). Narrowed from "review CLAUDE.md before using any other commands" to "Verify the Conventions section — `<!-- INFERRED -->` marks areas where code analysis was genuinely ambiguous."
- **`/adopt` Phase 4a** (`adopt.md`). Contradiction-resolution reframed as a plain engineering question: "Your existing codebase has [A] for [area]; your `[filename]` says [B]. Which is intended?" Safe default keeps the in-code pattern. "Accept all defaults" escape applies it to all contradictions without per-item prompting.

## 0.16.0 — 2026-06-09 (project-specific skill discovery + exemplar grounding)

> `/bootstrap` now mines each codebase for its own tribal-knowledge recipes — multi-step operations that recur with non-obvious, repo-specific steps no shipped template can predict. Found candidates are auto-written as skills with `origin: discovered` frontmatter (visible in the PR diff for review). Instance-shaped skills (`add-endpoint`, `add-entity`, `register-service`, and any mined `add-X`) are grounded in a real repo exemplar so the agent reproduces the project's conventions and structure, not an abstract template. The resurrection guard in `/rebootstrap` records removed mined skills as declined recipes in `LEARNINGS.md` so they are not re-proposed.

### Added
- **A8 pass: project-specific skill discovery** (`bootstrap-pass.md`, `bootstrap.md`). Runs unconditionally in every repo — mines naming/directory clusters whole-tree (no recency sampling), applies a tribal-knowledge criterion + framework-exclusion list, proposes ≤3–5 candidates. Respects `## Declined recipe:` entries in `LEARNINGS.md`.
- **Exemplar grounding** (`bootstrap.md` Phase 3a). For instance-shaped skills, pins a `see also` prose line to a real file in the repo. Quality-gated against Phase-2 synthesis: patterns flagged as debt are routed to `TECH_DEBT.md` instead.
- **Phase 4 mined-skills report** (`bootstrap.md`). PR-reviewable listing of discovered skills in plain engineering language.
- **Resurrection guard** (`rebootstrap.md`). Detects deleted mined skills and appends `## Declined recipe:` blocks to `LEARNINGS.md`; reported in Phase-4 final report.
- **Exemplar re-pinning in `/rebootstrap`**. Proposes updated `see also` lines when exemplar files move or a cleaner instance exists.
- **`LEARNINGS.md` declined-recipe convention**. Header now documents the auto-managed `## Declined recipe:` format so maintainers know not to remove these entries.

## 0.15.0 — 2026-06-06 (spec-driven development: explicit Tasks artifact)

> A targeted alignment after reviewing how the frontier labs and institutions (AWS Kiro, GitHub Spec-Kit, Google Antigravity, OpenAI Codex) frame AI-driven SDLC: they have converged on Spec → Plan → **Tasks** → Implement. The framework already had the spec lifecycle (`/design → spec → /feature → /review`, with CLAUDE.md as the "constitution") and is ahead on governance / calibration / eval — this adds the one element it underweighted: a persisted, checkable Tasks breakdown.

### Added
- **Tasks checklist in the spec lifecycle.** The `specs/<slug>.md` template now carries an ordered, checkable **Tasks** section (the *how* — distinct from acceptance criteria, the *what*). `/design` drafts it; `/feature` works through it and checks each `- [ ]` → `- [x]` **in the spec file** as it lands, so implementation progress survives across sessions and tools; `/review` flags any unchecked Task as incomplete work. No new command or artifact — an extension of the existing flow, and the lean answer to industry spec-driven development.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-06-06 (AI-driven SDLC hardening: security, calibration, brownfield safety)

> Bakes best-practice findings from METR, Google DORA 2025, Anthropic's Claude Code guidance, and Thoughtworks/Böckeler into the framework so they are **LLM-driven, not left to each developer**. Reframed after a multi-reviewer critique: the highest-leverage gaps were security and trust-calibration, not the originally-planned ones. LSP-over-MCP symbol grounding was evaluated and **deferred** (no maintained offline bridge for Windows/Bitbucket DC; 8–15 s/query; orphaned-process lifecycle) — `Read`/`Grep` + Verification Rules #1–2 remain the fallback.

### Added
- **`/adopt` trust-boundary + safety screen.** Discovered AI-config/doc files (`.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) are now treated as **untrusted input**: the agent never obeys instructions found inside them, and a provenance + adversarial-content scan (override phrasing, hidden-comment imperatives, exfiltration URLs) with **raw-content review** gates every merge into the canonical CLAUDE.md. Closes a prompt-injection hole on brownfield adoption.
- **Security-sensitive routing.** The `route-prompt` hook injects a security overlay (run `/security-review` / `security-auditor`; `decimal`-money/idempotency/TOCTOU reminders) whenever a prompt touches payments, balances, ledgers, auth, or secrets — stacked on top of any workflow rails, and standalone when no workflow matched. DORA: AI amplifies weaknesses fastest here.
- **Enforced plan-review & clarify gate.** For fix/feature/refactor/test the agent must present a plan, surface clarifying questions, and **wait for the developer's go-ahead before writing code** (CLAUDE.md Agentic Workflow + `route-prompt`). The human-in-the-loop checkpoint that also counters METR's perception gap.
- **Perception-gap feedback loop.** A "Verification & confidence" line (verified-by-running vs asserted) is now required on completed work (`workflow.md` + CLAUDE.md self-review); `/impact` gains a predicted-vs-actual calibration section and a "confidence is not correctness" honesty rule; two financial-correctness eval cases added (`decimal` for money; check-then-act + idempotency on a balance debit).
- **Known Hazard Areas.** A `/bootstrap`-drafted section in `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md` capturing the repo's "here be dragons" (load-bearing workarounds, undocumented invariants, tests that don't pin behaviour) with required epistemic status (`[UNVERIFIED]`/`[SUSPECTED]`/`[VERIFIED]`) and a 90-day re-confirm rule — the lean form of brownfield hazard capture (no new doc, no new subagent).
- **Characterization mode** in the `add-tests` skill: pin **observed** (not verified-correct) behaviour before a refactor, skeleton-then-run (never invent expected values), with a mandatory "OBSERVED not VERIFIED" header and a **HALT for human review on money/idempotency** so a characterization test can't silently bless a pre-existing financial bug. `/refactor` Step 2 now points at it.
- **AI-readiness disclosure.** `scripts/metrics.{ps1,sh}` emit a `readiness` block (CI present, measured coverage % or `null`=not-measured, `Nullable`/`TreatWarningsAsErrors`, tests present); `/impact` surfaces it as a **capability disclosure, never a gate** — a weak substrate is exactly where teams most need help.

### Notes
- LSP-over-MCP symbol grounding: **deferred** behind a spike with explicit kill criteria — cold-start >10 s, 8–15 s/query, orphaned language-server processes, and air-gapped install of `csharp-ls`/`typescript-language-server` + an MCP bridge infeasible on Bitbucket DC. Fallback: `Read`/`Grep` + Verification Rules #1–2.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-06-05 (hooks fire on Windows: PowerShell-default + CRLF-safe)

### Fixed
- **Claude Code hooks silently no-opped on Windows.** The default `.claude/settings.json` invoked `bash .claude/hooks/*.sh`; on a Windows box without git-bash on PATH (or with CRLF-mangled `.sh` files), the hooks failed quietly — so the framework's enforcement (secret/suppression blocking via the PreToolUse guard, the PostToolUse build + audit log, the Stop boy-scout check) **wasn't actually running**. The default now uses the PowerShell (`pwsh`) twins, which don't depend on bash. `scripts/install.ps1` falls back to Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`settings.windows.json`) when `pwsh` is absent; `scripts/install.sh` switches to the bash twins when `pwsh` is absent. Copilot's `.github/hooks/hooks.json` already declared both interpreters and was unaffected — this brings Claude Code to parity. (Reported from a real implementation.)
- **`.sh` hooks corrupted to CRLF on Windows checkout.** Added `.gitattributes` pinning `*.sh` (and `*.ps1`) to LF, so `core.autocrlf=true` can't rewrite the shebang line to `bash\r` and break the bash twins — the second reason the bash hooks failed on Windows.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-06-05 (impact harness: exclude build artifacts from the A/B diff)

### Fixed
- **Build artifacts leaked into the behavioral A/B file list.** `scripts/impact-run.{sh,ps1}` now exclude `bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.angular/`, `.vs/`, `TestResults/`, and `coverage/` from the captured diff via git pathspec exclusions (`:(exclude,glob)**/…/**`). Without it, a consumer repo that doesn't gitignore those dirs fed generated files — including generated `.cs` under `obj/` (`*.AssemblyInfo.cs`, `GlobalUsings.g.cs`) — into the acceptance asserts and the `metrics.sh` scorecard, corrupting the A/B signal and inflating file/LOC counts. We filter the file list rather than clean the tree — note `git clean -fd` does **not** remove ignored dirs like `bin`/`obj`; that needs `-fdx`. (Reported from a real implementation.)

## 0.13.0 — 2026-06-05 (presentation deck + impact-harness Windows/Copilot fixes)

### Added
- **Presentation deck** — `docs/presentation/framework-briefing.html`, a self-contained, offline HTML briefing (keyboard nav, built-in speaker-notes overlay, print-to-PDF) for pitching the framework to tech leads and their teams: overview + practical implications for both audiences. Companion **`docs/presentation/TALKING-POINTS.md`** carries two runs-of-show (leads vs teams), a pre-meeting checklist, per-slide notes, and anticipated Q&A. Listed in the README "What's in the box" table.

### Fixed
- **Impact harness was skipped during `/adopt`** (observed in a real Opus-4.6 adoption). `/adopt` Phase 9 is now **mandatory**, with a "Definition of done" that gates completion on `docs/impact/IMPACT.md` existing, and Phase 8 explicitly hands off to it — the report can no longer be silently dropped.
- **Copilot CLI not detected on Windows.** `scripts/impact-run.{sh,ps1}` now resolve the agent robustly — probing `copilot`, `copilot.cmd`, `copilot.exe`, and npm-global locations (`npm prefix -g`, `%APPDATA%\npm`) — instead of a single `command -v copilot`, which missed the npm-global `.cmd` shim. `/impact` now tells the agent to trust the runner's exit code (`3` = genuinely absent) rather than pre-judging availability with a bare PATH check.
- **`git worktree` failed on Windows long paths (MAX_PATH).** The behavioral A/B now creates worktrees at a short drive-root base (`<drive>:/iwt/wN`) with `core.longpaths=true`, instead of deep temp+GUID paths that overflowed the 260-char limit once a deep source tree was checked out.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-06-04 (CLAUDE.md review + README-drift check)

### Added
- **`docs-sync-check` README-drift check** — advisory NOTE when a skill (`.claude/skills/`) or agent (`.claude/agents/`) isn't mentioned in `README.md`, so the hand-maintained What's-in-the-box / subagents tables can't silently fall behind (the gap that had let the README drift to 0.7.2).

### Fixed
- **Boy Scout rule "inline single-consumer interfaces" contradicted mandatory SOLID/DIP.** Reworded in CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md to carve out DI service seams: service interfaces are required even with one implementation and must never be inlined; only data/internal abstractions are inline candidates.
- **CLAUDE.md Agentic Workflow** now references persisting a `specs/<slug>.md` spec for larger features (it lagged the AGENTS.md mirror and the `/design`→`/feature` flow).
- **CLAUDE.md drift note** now says to regenerate `copilot-instructions.md` **and** `AGENTS.md` (both are generated by `/generate-copilot`).

## 0.11.1 — 2026-06-04 (README accuracy)

### Fixed
- **README reference sections brought up to date** with the current toolset: What's-in-the-box now lists `solid-check`, `enforce-architecture`, the impact-harness scripts, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` / `REVIEW-GUIDE.md`; the subagents table shows all six (incl. `solid-check`, now "six … five user-facing"); `/impact` added to the command list. The embedded changelog had drifted to 0.7.2 — it now points to `CHANGELOG.md` instead of duplicating it.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-06-04 (deterministic SOLID backstop + PowerShell parity)

### Added
- **`enforce-architecture` skill** — scaffolds the **deterministic** DIP/layering CI gate that complements the semantic `solid-check` agent: a NetArchTest test project enforcing dependency direction (Domain ⊄ Infrastructure, Application ⊄ Infrastructure/API), with a copy-paste sample at `scripts/ci/ArchitectureTests.sample.cs`. Referenced from `CLAUDE.md > SOLID` and Common Tasks.
- **PowerShell twins** for the impact harness — `scripts/metrics.ps1` and `scripts/impact-run.ps1` — so Windows-only / PowerShell shops get full parity (the bash versions remain primary).

## 0.10.0 — 2026-06-04 (impact harness)

### Added
- **Impact harness** — a fully automated before/after of the framework's value, run by `/adopt` (and standalone via `/impact`), with **no user input**.
  - **`/impact` command** (+ Copilot prompt wrapper): writes `docs/impact/IMPACT.md` and a generated `docs/impact/impact.html`.
  - **Tier 1 (always):** a capability diff (old setup archived in `docs/pre-adoption/` vs this framework) + a deterministic codebase scorecard via `scripts/metrics.sh` (anti-pattern / SOLID-DIP / security / test counts → JSON), baselined at adoption (`docs/impact/baseline.json`).
  - **Tier 2 (if Copilot CLI is present):** a behavioral A/B — `scripts/impact-run.sh` runs `tests/impact/tasks.json` through the headless agent **twice**, in throwaway git worktrees at the `pre-adoption` tag (old framework) vs `HEAD` (this one), N trials each, capturing build / acceptance-asserts / anti-patterns-on-diff per run. Only the framework differs between arms.
  - `/adopt` Phase 0 freezes the baseline and tags `pre-adoption` **before any change**; Phase 9 runs `/impact`.
- **`scripts/build-architecture-html.{sh,ps1}` generalized** to `[src] [out] [title]`, so `/impact` renders `impact.html` from the same drift-safe generator.

### Note
- Tier 2 needs a headless agent (Copilot CLI), authenticated once; without it, Tier 1 still runs. Results are stochastic — read trials as a distribution and pin the same model in both arms. PowerShell twins of `metrics`/`impact-run` are a follow-up (the harness already requires git-bash, a framework prerequisite).

## 0.9.1 — 2026-06-04 (architecture docs + AI install path)

### Added
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — canonical, human-readable architecture map with Mermaid diagrams (three-tier model, source→generated flow, hook lifecycle, GitHub-vs-Bitbucket surface split, repo map). Renders on GitHub/Bitbucket; AI agents still read CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, not this.
- **`docs/architecture.html`** — generated from ARCHITECTURE.md by `scripts/build-architecture-html.{sh,ps1}` (renders diagrams via marked + mermaid; embeds the source so it cannot silently drift). Cross-tool `src-sha1` marker; `docs-sync-check` flags staleness.
- **`docs/REVIEW-GUIDE.md`** — a senior reviewer's annotated tour: reading order, what each piece guarantees, how to verify it, and the tradeoffs worth probing.
- **`scripts/install.{sh,ps1}`** — install the framework into a target repo (excludes `.git` and the `.template-repo` marker), then prints next steps; plus an "Implementing this framework (for an AI agent)" entrypoint in the README.
- **`docs-sync-check`** gains an `architecture.html` freshness check.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-06-04 (literal SOLID)

### Added
- **SOLID is now mandatory** — a standing `## SOLID` section in CLAUDE.md (mirrored to AGENTS.md): an interface for **every injected service** (DIP), plus SRP / OCP / LSP / ISP rules. Literal classic SOLID, per tech-lead mandate. Data carriers (DTOs, entities, value objects, `Options`) are exempt — they are not services.
- **`solid-check` subagent** (`.claude/agents/` + `.github/agents/` mirror), dispatched by `/review` Step 1 alongside convention-check / bloat-radar / debt-radar. Covers the five principles semantically; self-skips in repos without a `## SOLID` section.
- **`docs/architecture-decisions.md`** is now the home for full ADRs; `docs/defaults.md` DI section mandates interface-per-service for greenfield.

### Changed
- **Leanness #2 reconciled with SOLID**: interfaces are now expected for injected services; the anti-bloat teeth remain on *data* (never interface a DTO/entity/value object) and on *speculation* (no abstractions for hypothetical variation).
- **`bloat-radar` recalibrated**: it no longer flags a single-implementation interface on an injected service (required by DIP now); it still flags interfaces/abstractions on non-service types, speculative bases, and helper classes. The SOLID lens moved to `solid-check`.
- **`/generate-copilot`** now emits a SOLID block into `copilot-instructions.md` and copies the full SOLID section into the `AGENTS.md` mirror.
- **Eval suite** flipped to the new policy: `dotnet-001` now requires `IEmailNotifier`; `dotnet-004` requires `ISmsService` **and** still forbids a speculative provider factory (DIP yes, future-proofing no).

### Fixed
- **`/adopt` ADR merge** now appends full ADRs to `docs/architecture-decisions.md` with a one-line index in CLAUDE.md (was pasting them inline), matching the `create-adr` skill and `/bootstrap` Phase 3a — keeps CLAUDE.md within budget and the prompt cache warm.

### Note
- Deterministic DIP backstop is **NetArchTest** (dependency-direction tests in CI); the semantic SOLID gate is the `solid-check` agent. Wire NetArchTest into your test project to fail builds on layer violations.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-06-04 (cross-tool parity + Bitbucket + spec-driven)

### Added
- **AGENTS.md is now a generated full mirror** of CLAUDE.md's portable rules (Verification, Leanness, Conventions, Boy Scout, Agentic Workflow) — not a pointer — so AGENTS.md-native tools (GitHub Copilot agent mode & CLI, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Aider) get the real ruleset. Emitted by `/generate-copilot` Part B; produced by `/bootstrap` Phase 3f; checked for drift by `/docs-sync` Step 2 and the CI guardrail.
- **Skills now reach Copilot.** `.claude/skills/` is mirrored byte-for-byte to `.github/skills/` (Copilot CLI / cloud agent read that path; VS Code Copilot already reads `.claude/skills/`). New `scripts/sync-agent-files.{sh,ps1}` regenerates the mirror, `/generate-copilot` Part C runs it, and the CI guardrail enforces parity.
- **Subagents exposed to Copilot** as custom agents: `.github/agents/{security-auditor,convention-check,bloat-radar,debt-radar}.agent.md` — thin wrappers delegating to the canonical `.claude/agents/` definitions (same single-source pattern as the prompt files).
- **PreToolUse guard hook** (`guard.sh` + `.ps1`) — hard-blocks any write that adds `#pragma warning disable` or a hardcoded secret (private key, cloud token, credential literal). Registered in `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.windows.json`, and `.github/hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code: exit-2 block; Copilot: JSON deny). Deterministic enforcement of Verification Rule #7.
- **Spec-driven development**: a `specs/` directory with `specs/README.md` (template + lifecycle). `/design` persists a spec to `specs/<slug>.md`, `/feature` implements against it, `/review` verifies conformance. CLAUDE.md is framed as the project "constitution".
- **New skills**: `add-tests` (xUnit + `WebApplicationFactory`), `dependency-audit` (vulnerable NuGet + Dependabot/Renovate setup), `create-adr` (inline ADRs in CLAUDE.md > Architecture Decisions).
- **Bitbucket Data Center support**: a README "Running on Bitbucket Data Center" section (what works locally vs what's GitHub-only — incl. Atlassian Rovo Dev being Cloud-only); host-agnostic `scripts/docs-sync-check.{sh,ps1}`; `scripts/ci/bitbucket-pipelines.example.yml`; and Code Insights / pre-receive / Bamboo wiring guidance. `/security-review` gains a "Standing scanners" note (CodeQL on GitHub; Semgrep/SonarQube + Code Insights on Bitbucket).

### Fixed
- **A7 bootstrap pass was dead.** `/bootstrap` dispatched seven passes (incl. **A7 Financial Domain Invariants**) but `bootstrap-pass` only accepted A1–A6 and Phase 2 synthesised "six" — so the financial-domain analysis silently never ran. `bootstrap-pass`, Phase 2, the README agents table, and the `/bootstrap` + `/rebootstrap` prompt wrappers now all agree on **seven (A1–A7)**.

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/docs-sync-check.yml` is now a thin caller of `scripts/docs-sync-check.sh` (host-agnostic) and is marked GitHub-only. The script also verifies the AGENTS.md mirror is current and that `.github/skills` matches `.claude/skills`.
- `/generate-copilot` now regenerates **both** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (slim) and `AGENTS.md` (full mirror), and syncs the skills mirror.

### Token economy
- **Model routing**: `convention-check`, `bloat-radar`, and `debt-radar` now run on **Haiku** (recurring, pattern-based work); `security-auditor` and `bootstrap-pass` stay on the inherited strong model (high-stakes / one-time-high-leverage). Cuts per-`/review` cost without losing security or bootstrap quality.
- **Quiet-on-success hooks**: `post-write.{sh,ps1}` emit `dotnet build` output **only on failure** — a successful write no longer injects a build summary into context.
- **CLAUDE.md size budget**: `docs-sync-check.{sh,ps1}` prints an advisory NOTE when CLAUDE.md exceeds ~400 lines (it loads on nearly every turn and anchors the prompt cache); `/bootstrap` Phase 3a documents the budget.
- **ADRs out of the hot path**: the `create-adr` skill now appends full ADRs to `docs/architecture-decisions.md` with a one-line index in CLAUDE.md, instead of pasting them inline — stops the always-loaded file from growing and avoids busting the prompt cache on every recorded decision. `/bootstrap` Phase 3a follows the same split.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-05-16 (Copilot routing parity)

### Fixed
- **Natural-language routing in Copilot was a silent no-op.** Per the [GitHub Copilot hooks reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-configuration), the `userPromptSubmitted` event is fire-and-forget — stdout is discarded, so `route-prompt.sh|ps1` couldn't inject workflow rails on the Copilot side regardless of schema correctness. Removed the misleading `userPromptSubmitted` entry from `.github/hooks/hooks.json`.

### Added
- **Workflow-routing primer in `SessionStart`** (both `session-start.sh` and `session-start.ps1`). Once per session, the hook emits the seven workflow names with their trigger vocabulary so the model can self-classify natural-language prompts in Copilot. In Claude Code the per-prompt `route-prompt` router still runs and dominates; the primer is harmless reinforcement there.

### Changed
- **README "Deterministic hooks" table** now flags `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` as Claude Code only and distinguishes per-prompt routing (Claude Code) from session primer + self-classification (Copilot).

## 0.7.1 — 2026-05-15 (hook plumbing forensic-fix batch)

### Fixed
- **`.claude/settings.json` hook schema** (both bash and PowerShell variants). Restructured to the documented Claude Code form: each event entry now wraps handlers in a nested `hooks` array with explicit `"type": "command"`. The previous flattened form was non-conformant and likely failed to register hooks on recent Claude Code versions.
- **`.github/hooks/hooks.json` schema**. Added the required `"version": 1` field; converted the top-level `hooks` from an array to an object keyed by event name; added `"type": "command"` to every handler; added `timeoutSec` per event. The prior shape did not match the GitHub Copilot hooks reference and the hooks almost certainly weren't being loaded by the cloud agent.
- **Tool-name filter in hook scripts** (`post-write.{sh,ps1}`, `audit-trail.{sh,ps1}`). The filter previously accepted only Claude Code's `Write`/`Edit` (PascalCase); GitHub Copilot uses `edit`/`create` (lowercase). Every Copilot file-write event was being silently dropped before path extraction. Filter now accepts both surfaces.
- **`toolArgs` parsing** in the same scripts. Per the Copilot hooks spec, `toolArgs` is a parsed object, not a JSON-encoded string. The previous `jq fromjson` / `ConvertFrom-Json` paths threw and were silently swallowed by `2>/dev/null`, so file-path extraction from Copilot payloads returned empty. Switched to direct object access, with a fallback string-parse for legacy payload shapes.
- **Prompt-file frontmatter** — `mode: agent` → `agent: agent` across all 13 `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` files. `mode` was deprecated by VS Code in favor of `agent` (see `github/awesome-copilot#464`).
- **`settings.windows.json` audit-trail parity** — the bash variant registered two `PostToolUse` hooks (post-write + audit-trail); the PowerShell variant only registered post-write, so Windows-only PowerShell teams had no SR 11-7 / DORA audit log. Added the audit-trail handler.
- **Bogus `$schema` URL** in `framework-version.json`. Removed — the URL pointed to a non-existent GitHub org.
- **Tracked runtime state** — removed `.claude/.state/last-build-ts` from the working tree. It is gitignored but had been committed before the rule was added.
- **`post-write` throttle window** — raised from 5 s to 60 s. Real `dotnet build` runs take 30 s+; the 5 s throttle expired long before the in-flight build finished, so burst writes still stomped on the running compile.
- **Boy-scout `!` (null-forgiving) detector** false-positive on `x!=y` (no surrounding spaces). Now requires the `!` to be in postfix-operator position.

### Changed
- **README hook-compatibility table**. The "VS Code Copilot reads `.claude/settings.json` directly" row was unfounded — VS Code Copilot's surfaces are `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/`, `.github/prompts/`, and `.github/hooks/`. The table is now two rows: Claude Code (CLI + VS Code extension) and GitHub Copilot (cloud + CLI), with the exact payload shape per surface.

### Added
- **Cleanly bail-out guard** in `post-write`: skip if the `dotnet` CLI is not on PATH, instead of failing noisily.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-04-28 (anti-bloat batch)

### Added
- **Leanness conventions** in `CLAUDE.md`. Counterweight to Boy Scout's add-bias: no interface without a second consumer, wrappers must add behavior, prefer editing over creating, deletion is a contribution.
- **`bloat-radar` subagent**. Scans diffs for speculative abstractions, shallow wrappers, parallel implementations, comment debris, defensive over-coding, trivial tests, and net-LOC density. Wired into `/review` alongside `convention-check` and `debt-radar`.
- **Anti-bloat rails** appended to `feature` and `refactor` workflow rails (route-prompt bash + PowerShell). Refactor now reports net LOC delta; growth requires explicit reason.
- **Boy Scout: Subtract** subsection in `CLAUDE.md`. Always-apply subtractions (unused usings, commented-out blocks, unreferenced privates) and primary-target subtractions (inline single-consumer interfaces, collapse shallow wrappers).
- **Stop hook** (`boy-scout-check.sh` + `.ps1`) now flags commented-out code blocks (2+ contiguous code-like `//` lines).
- **`/security-review` command + `security-auditor` subagent**. OWASP-style scan: injection / XSS / auth-authz / secrets / sensitive data / crypto / transport / dependencies. Wired into Copilot via `.github/prompts/security-review.prompt.md`.
- **Eval harness** (`tests/evals/`). Tiny regression suite that probes the rules CLAUDE.md + FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md encode (Verification, Leanness, Boy Scout, no future-proofing, no defensive over-coding). Two grading layers per case: deterministic regex + Haiku-graded rubric. Uses prompt caching with a `cache_control` breakpoint at end of CLAUDE.md so subsequent cases hit cache. Five cases, run quarterly or after framework version bumps.

### Changed
- `/feature` Step 1 includes a Leanness check before scoping the work.
- `/refactor` Step 7 now requires reporting net LOC delta.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **PowerShell hook variants** for Windows-only PowerShell teams. Ships `.ps1` equivalents of `session-start`, `route-prompt`, `boy-scout-check`, `post-write`, and `audit-trail` alongside the bash versions, plus a `settings.windows.json` users can swap into `.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.local.json`). Uses Windows PowerShell 5.1 — preinstalled on every Windows machine, no extra install. (Resolves the "hooks disabled on PowerShell-only Windows" caveat in the README compatibility table.)
- **`FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md` template**. Cross-repo context file for shared library APIs, multi-tenancy conventions, dashboard contracts, and cross-service patterns. Maintainer-curated; bootstrap auto-populates the "Detected Framework Packages" table from `*.csproj` / `Directory.Packages.props`. CLAUDE.md still wins on conflicts; agent flags contradictions.
- **`/bootstrap` Phase 3d**: detects framework packages and populates `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md > Detected Framework Packages`. Removes the `DETECTED_FRAMEWORK_PACKAGES_PENDING` marker on success.
- **`/docs-sync` Step 4**: re-scans for framework package add/remove/version-bump and flags drift in FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md.
- **CI guardrail check**: `docs-sync-check.yml` now verifies `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md` exists and the bootstrap marker has been removed.

### Fixed
- **`route-prompt.sh` JSON parsing** no longer truncates on prompts containing escaped quotes (`\"`). Now prefers `jq` (handles all JSON escapes), falls back to `python3` / `python`, and finally to a regex that decodes common escapes. Same fix applied to the PowerShell variant via `ConvertFrom-Json`.

### Decided
- **Multi-repo architecture (Option B chosen)**: framework context is baked into each template via `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md` rather than a central `ai-framework-context` repo. Self-contained repos avoid the unverified `--add-dir` mechanism and the silent-failure onboarding risk. Drift mitigated by `/docs-sync` and the CI guardrail. See `project_framework_architecture.md` for the full rationale.

## How to update this changelog

- One section per release (or per "Unreleased" working window). Date the heading.
- Group entries by **Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Decided**.
- One line per change. Reference the file or workflow touched, not the implementation detail.
- Keep entries scoped to this template. Cross-stack decisions go in `project_framework_architecture.md`; the sibling Angular template tracks its own changes in [`ai-tech-lead-angular/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/andreoucostas/ai-tech-lead-angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
- When a framework-level change lands in both templates, write the entry separately in each — they'll diverge in detail (file paths, language idioms) and shared editing tends to drift anyway.

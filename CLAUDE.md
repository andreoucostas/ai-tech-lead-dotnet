# [Project Name]

> This file is the single source of truth for AI-assisted development in this repository.
> Claude Code loads this file directly. GitHub Copilot (agent mode & CLI), Codex, Cursor, Gemini, and Aider read its generated mirror **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** (kept in sync by `/generate-copilot`). Edit conventions here, never in AGENTS.md.
> Run `/bootstrap` to populate it from your actual codebase.
>
> **Companion file**: [FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md](./FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md) holds cross-repo context (shared libraries, multi-tenancy conventions, dashboard contracts) plus the repo's **Known Hazard Areas**, all of which the agent should load on every non-trivial task — consult the hazard list for the change's blast radius before planning. CLAUDE.md wins on any conflict — but flag the contradiction.

> **Per-developer working preferences** (e.g. "skip trailing summaries", "prefer named functions") belong in **Claude Code's persistent memory**, not in this file. Use phrasings like "remember to do X" during sessions; CLAUDE.md is for repo-shared conventions only.

## Verification Rules

These apply to every workflow, before any convention-level rule. The difference between confident output and hallucinated output.

1. **Verify before you reference.** Before naming a class, method, file, route, NuGet package, namespace, or DI registration extension, confirm it exists in this codebase via `Read` / `Grep`. If you cannot confirm, say so explicitly rather than guessing.
2. **Never invent APIs.** Do not fabricate method signatures, type names, attributes, package exports, or framework features. Read the source. If a referenced shared-library API is not in `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md > Detected Framework Packages` at the version this repo pins, treat it as unverified.
3. **Honour version pinning.** Before suggesting a feature from a shared library, framework, or `Microsoft.*` package, confirm the version in `FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md > Detected Framework Packages` actually has it. The latest API surface in `Shared Libraries` may not exist in older versions.
4. **State uncertainty.** When a question depends on context you do not have (a file you have not read, runtime behaviour you cannot observe, a database state you cannot query), say so. Do not guess to seem helpful.
5. **Tests are immutable safety nets during fixes and refactors.** When an existing test fails, production is wrong (or the test is wrong for a documented reason). Do not edit assertions to make them pass without flagging it explicitly.
6. **No invented fixtures.** When sample data, builders, factories, or mocks already exist, reuse them. Do not fabricate parallel ones.
7. **Failures are signals.** Build, test, or analyser failures are diagnostic. Read the message and fix the cause; never wrap in try/catch or `#pragma warning disable` to silence. (A PreToolUse hook hard-blocks writes that add `#pragma warning disable`.)
8. **No future-proofing.** Do not add code for hypothetical requirements. Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.
9. **A new test must be seen to fail before it is trusted.** Before relying on a new behavioral test as green, confirm it actually goes red when the behavior is broken — write it before the fix (bug fixes), or briefly break the code under test and watch it fail for the right reason. Where running the red is impractical, state the specific defect the test would catch. *Why: AI-generated tests are the highest-risk for tautological or over-mocked assertions that pass even against broken code; a test you have watched fail cannot be vacuous.*

## Leanness

The Boy Scout Rule biases toward adding improvements. This section is the counterweight: every change should also consider what to remove or what not to introduce. Bloat is not a stylistic preference — it is the highest-cost long-term failure mode of AI-assisted development.

### Defaults

1. **Edit existing files; do not create new ones unless required.** A new file is a long-term commitment. If a method fits an existing file, put it there.
2. **Interfaces are for injected services (SOLID/DIP) and for genuine second implementations — not for data.** Every injected service is depended on through an interface (see [SOLID](#solid)); the implementation may be `sealed`. *Outside* that rule, no interface or abstraction without a real need — data carriers (DTOs, entities, value objects, `Options` records) never get interfaces, and don't invent abstractions for hypothetical variation.
3. **No abstract base class with one subclass.** Inline it.
4. **Wrappers must add behavior.** A method that just delegates is a layer that costs reading time and adds no value. Inline or remove.
5. **No defensive code for impossible states.** Trust internal callers; validate only at system boundaries (HTTP request body, message bus payload, third-party API response). **Financial domain exception**: for monetary amounts, ledger entries, account balances, regulatory figures, and idempotency keys — treat every state as possible regardless of caller. Use `decimal` (never `double`) for money; guard against negative amounts, duplicate transaction IDs, decimal precision loss, and timestamp ordering violations at every layer even in internal code.
6. **No `try/catch` to silence; only to handle.** If you cannot say what the catch block does for the user, do not write it.
7. **No comments that restate code.** A comment earns its place only when it captures a non-obvious *why* (constraint, invariant, workaround). XML doc comments on public APIs are an exception when the project ships them.
8. **No new generic helpers / utility classes without two existing call sites.** Three similar lines beat a premature abstraction.
9. **Deletion is a contribution.** If a change makes existing code obsolete, delete it in the same PR. Comment-out is never the answer; that is what version control is for.
10. **No re-exports through barrel files unless the barrel already exports adjacent symbols.** Do not grow the public surface for free.

### Test leanness

11. **Do not test getters, setters, or trivial constructors.** Test behavior, not assignment.
12. **Do not test the framework.** No tests that DI resolves, that EF Core can read its own writes, that ASP.NET model-binding parses an int.
13. **Reuse existing builders / fixtures.** Do not introduce parallel test data unless the existing builders cannot represent the case.
14. **No over-mocking.** Mock only true external boundaries — network, clock, filesystem, third-party SDKs, the database when an in-memory substitute won't do. Never mock the type under test or its owned collaborators when a real or in-memory instance is cheap; prefer a fake/in-memory over an interaction mock for code you own. *Why: AI assistants frequently produce tests that assert on mock interactions and would still pass if the real code were broken — see [Verification Rules](#verification-rules) #9.*
15. **No tautological assertions.** A test whose only assertion is `Assert.True(true)`, a not-null check on a freshly-constructed object, or "the mock was called" verifies nothing. Assert the observable return value, state change, or emitted effect. *Why: a large share of LLM-generated assertions are weak or vacuous — they bank coverage without catching regressions.*
16. **Assert behavior, not implementation.** Do not assert private state, internal call order that isn't part of the contract, or exact log strings. A refactor that preserves behavior must not break the test.

### When you must add structure

If a change genuinely requires a new abstraction, file, or wrapper, state the second consumer (existing or imminent) in the design or PR description. "Imminent" means within the same change-set. Otherwise: defer the abstraction until the second case appears.

---

## SOLID

SOLID is **mandatory** in this codebase. It governs structure; [Leanness](#leanness) governs ceremony *beyond* that structure — the two are reconciled here and in Leanness #2.

1. **Single Responsibility** — one reason to change per class. No god classes; controllers stay thin (delegate to a service immediately). Split a class that mixes orchestration, data access, and presentation. Heuristic: more than ~5 injected collaborators, or a name needing "And"/"Manager", means split.
2. **Open/Closed** — extend by adding a type, not editing a stable one. When a `switch`/`if` over a type/enum code reaches its **third** arm, replace it with polymorphism. (Do not build the seam speculatively before then — that is future-proofing.)
3. **Liskov Substitution** — every implementation fulfils its interface's contract completely: no `NotImplementedException`/`NotSupportedException`, no strengthened preconditions, no weakened postconditions. If a type can't honour the contract, it must not implement it.
4. **Interface Segregation** — small, role-based interfaces over one fat `I*Service`. No implementation is forced to implement members it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion** — **every injected service/behaviour is depended on through an interface**, registered in DI; higher layers never `new` a concrete service or depend on a concrete lower layer. Data carriers (DTOs, entities, value objects, `Options` records, enums) are **not** services — they get no interface.

**Mechanism**: define `IFoo` beside `Foo`; register `services.AddScoped<IFoo, Foo>()` via the project's DI extension; inject `IFoo`. Implementations may be `sealed`.

**Deterministic backstop**: dependency *direction* is enforced in CI by architecture tests (**NetArchTest** — e.g. Domain must not reference Infrastructure). The `solid-check` agent covers the semantic principles per diff and is run by `/review`. Scaffold the NetArchTest gate with the `enforce-architecture` skill.

## Codebase Context

<!-- Populated by /bootstrap — do not fill manually -->

What this application does, who uses it, key domain concepts, and critical user journeys.

---

## Repository Structure

<!-- Populated by /bootstrap — replaces separate CODEMAP.md -->

Project layout, layering strategy, dependency direction between projects, entry points, and where to put new code.

Include a text or mermaid diagram showing project dependencies.

## Conventions

<!-- BOOTSTRAP_PENDING: run /bootstrap to replace this entire section with conventions observed in the actual codebase. -->
<!-- Until /bootstrap runs, defer to docs/defaults.md for greenfield .NET conventions. -->
<!-- Each convention: the rule, then 1-2 sentence rationale. -->

_Not yet populated. Until you run `/bootstrap`, the greenfield defaults in [docs/defaults.md](./docs/defaults.md) apply. After bootstrap, this section becomes the authoritative source._

## Common Tasks

Recipes live as **skills**, auto-discovered by both Claude Code (`.claude/skills/`) and GitHub Copilot (`.github/skills/`) — the model triggers the relevant one when you describe that kind of task. Current skills:

- `add-endpoint` — add a new HTTP API endpoint end-to-end (domain → service → DTO → validator → controller → integration test)
- `add-entity` — add a new EF Core entity with configuration and migration review
- `register-service` — register a new service in DI with the right lifetime
- `add-tests` — add unit/integration tests following project patterns (xUnit + `WebApplicationFactory`)
- `perf` — scan a file, directory, or the whole repo for ~50 performance anti-patterns; produces tiered findings (Critical / Moderate / Info) with file locations and TECH_DEBT.md integration
- `dependency-audit` — scan for vulnerable/deprecated/outdated NuGet packages and set up automated dependency scanning (Dependabot or Renovate)
- `create-adr` — record a significant architecture decision in Architecture Decisions
- `enforce-architecture` — wire the deterministic DIP/layering CI gate (NetArchTest)

`/bootstrap` adds project-specific skills under `.claude/skills/`, grounding instance-shaped recipes in a real repo exemplar. Skills are mirrored to `.github/skills/` by `/generate-copilot` (and `scripts/sync-agent-files`) so Copilot CLI/agent see them too.

**Registers**: [TECH_DEBT.md](./TECH_DEBT.md) tracks delivery debt. [SECURITY_FINDINGS.md](./SECURITY_FINDINGS.md) tracks security findings separately with remediation SLAs (Critical = 7 days, High = 30 days). Do not merge them — audit teams treat these differently. AI-assisted file changes are appended to [.claude/ai-audit.log](./.claude/ai-audit.log) automatically by the PostToolUse hook.

## Boy Scout Rule

When touching any file, leave it cleaner than you found it. The rule is symmetric: improvements *add* missing pieces and *remove* dead weight. Deletion is a contribution.

### Always apply (low-effort, low-risk — do these on every touched file):

**Add:**
1. Missing `CancellationToken` propagation
2. Replace string-interpolated log messages with structured logging
3. Missing null checks at public boundaries
4. Missing `.AsNoTracking()` on read-only queries

**Subtract:**
5. Unused `using` directives
6. Commented-out code blocks (more than 1 line — version control preserves them)
7. Unreferenced private fields, methods, or local variables that the IDE/compiler flags

### Apply only when the file is the primary target of the change:

**Add:**
8. Split fat methods (>30 lines) into focused private methods
9. Missing unit tests for public methods you're modifying

**Subtract:**
10. Inline single-consumer interfaces or abstract bases **that are not DI service seams** (data/internal abstractions only) — per Leanness. Service interfaces are required by SOLID/DIP even with one implementation; never inline those.
11. Collapse shallow delegate methods that add no behavior beyond calling another component
12. Single-use private helpers — inline at the call site

Items 8–12 can significantly expand or reshape a diff. Only apply them when the file is what the task is specifically about, not when it's incidentally touched. This keeps PRs focused and reviewable.

**When to skip**: hotfixes, time-sensitive production incidents, and proof-of-concept branches. If skipping, add a comment `// TODO: Boy Scout skipped — [reason]` so it's picked up on the next pass. Use `/debt` to clean up later.

---

## Agentic Workflow

When given any task, follow this execution model:

### 1. Classify the intent — and run that workflow without being asked
Developers will rarely type a slash command. Treat any natural-language request as the trigger: silently classify it, **announce in one line which workflow you concluded** ("Reading this as a *fix*…"), and apply that workflow's rails below. If two workflows genuinely fit, ask one clarifying question first. If it's a pure question ("why does this throw?", "what does `X` do?"), just answer it — no workflow ceremony. You may combine workflows for a compound request ("fix this and add a test"), but **never silently drop a workflow's non-negotiables** to do so.

> These rails are the **canonical definition** of each workflow. `commands/*.md` and the `route-prompt` hook elaborate them but must not contradict them; `/docs-sync` checks they stay aligned. On Copilot (VS Code & CLI) this text is the *only* thing that reaches the model — treat it as binding, not advisory.

- **Feature** — *add / implement / create / build new …*: design check first (affected layers, files to create/modify, failure modes, test strategy) → decompose into ordered subtasks, running `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` after each → Boy Scout every touched file → self-review against Conventions → present what was built and tested. Honour Leanness: no new interface/abstraction without a second consumer in this change-set.
- **Bug fix** — *broken / bug / crash / failing / "not working" / "looks off"*: **state the root cause before writing any code** → write a failing regression test that fails for the *right reason* **before** touching production code → apply the *minimal* fix (no unrelated refactor) → verify the regression test + related suite + build + lint all pass → apply Boy Scout to the **blast radius only** → report root cause, fix, regression coverage, blast radius.
- **Refactor** — *cleanup / extract / rename / simplify / restructure*: **build + tests must pass before you touch anything**; if the target has no tests, write baseline (characterization) tests first → refactor incrementally, building + testing after each step → Boy Scout touched files → verify behaviour is unchanged → present a before/after summary **including net LOC delta**.
- **Test** — *write / add tests, increase coverage*: match existing test structure, naming, framework, mocking → cover happy path, edge cases, error paths, boundaries → **assert observable behaviour, not framework internals or implementation detail; no over-mocking, no tautological assertions** → a new behavioural test must be *seen to fail* before it is trusted (red before green) → verify new tests pass → report what's tested and what's still uncovered.
- **Investigation / design** — *design X / approach for / trade-offs / "how should I"*: **write no code** → understand the requirement → analyse impact → weigh at least two approaches with pros/cons + effort → recommend with specifics → surface open questions before implementation.
- **Debt cleanup** — *tech debt / cleanup debt*: read `TECH_DEBT.md` and find items in the area → confirm each still exists in the code (may already be fixed) → recommend fix-now vs defer with reasons → after fixes, update `TECH_DEBT.md` → Boy Scout touched files → report fixed/deferred plus the `TECH_DEBT.md` diff.

What is *guaranteed* vs merely *instructed* here depends on the surface — see `docs/enforcement-surfaces.md`. On Claude Code these rails are reinforced by a per-prompt hook and a write-time guard; on Copilot only this text reaches the model.

**Security-sensitive surfaces always get a security pass.** If the work touches authentication/authorization, payments, balances, ledgers, transactions, idempotency, or secrets, run `/security-review` on the diff (or the `security-auditor` agent) before presenting it as complete — regardless of which workflow above applies. On Claude Code a `UserPromptSubmit` hook flags these automatically; on Copilot it does not — the rule holds regardless.

### 2. Plan before coding — present, clarify, then get the go-ahead
For any non-trivial task, STOP before writing code and post a short plan:
- The files you'll create or modify, and the order of operations
- What tests will verify success
- Your assumptions, plus **clarifying questions** for anything underspecified (ambiguous scope, unclear acceptance criteria, competing approaches). Do not guess past a material ambiguity to seem helpful — ask.
- For larger features, persist the plan as a spec to `specs/<slug>.md` (see `/design`) and implement against it

Then **wait for the developer's explicit go-ahead before editing code.** This checkpoint is where a wrong assumption gets caught before it becomes a wrong diff — and where the developer stays engaged with the change instead of rubber-stamping output. Skip the wait only for a trivial, unambiguous change (typo, one-liner), and say that you're skipping it and why.

### 3. Execute in verified subtasks
For features and complex changes, decompose into ordered subtasks:
1. Domain/model layer changes + tests
2. Service/application layer changes + tests
3. API/controller layer changes + tests
4. Integration test covering the full flow

Each subtask must leave the codebase compilable and test-passing.
Run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` after each subtask. Fix failures before moving on.

### 4. Boy Scout every touched file
Check the Boy Scout Rule list above. Apply relevant improvements to every file you modify.

### 5. Self-review before presenting
Before presenting work as complete:
- Review your changes against the Conventions section above
- Verify all tests pass
- Check if the change introduces a new pattern → flag that this file needs updating
- Check if the change resolves a TECH_DEBT.md item → flag for removal
- Check if the change contradicts any convention → ask whether to update the convention or change the implementation
- **Close with a Verification & confidence line**: separate what you actually verified by running it (build / tests / lint — name which you ran) from what you assert without having run it, and flag anything you could not verify. Show the evidence — the command you ran and its observed result (e.g. `dotnet test` → 142 passed, 0 failed), not the bare claim "tests pass." This calibration is deliberate — it counters the well-documented tendency to feel more done than the work is.

### 6. Flag documentation drift
At the end of your response, note if:
- A new pattern was introduced that should be documented here
- A TECH_DEBT.md entry was resolved or a new one discovered
- A SECURITY_FINDINGS.md entry was resolved or a new finding discovered
- `copilot-instructions.md` / `AGENTS.md` need regeneration (run `/generate-copilot` in Claude Code, or ask your agent to rewrite them from this file following the rules in `.claude/commands/generate-copilot.md`)

## What We've Learned

Long-form learnings live in [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md). Read it when starting non-trivial work; append to it (don't overwrite) when you discover what works, what causes friction, or what rule needs adjusting.
